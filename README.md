# CRUD

This project is for testing the CRUD operation and API functionality.
This can be run using Docker.
And Swagger is added for API documentation.

STEPS:
1. Run this command in local : docker run -p 8080:8000 souravsinha1997/crud-simple:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.
Project is running on 8000 internally, based on requirement and available ports 8080 can be changed.

2. Give http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/ in browser. It will open the API documentation and can be tested from there. (Port 8080 needs to be changed based on the selected port in previous step)
